/**
 * Interface for a numerical integration method
 * 
 * Note that the state is stored in a variable called p, but other good variable names 
 * would have been y as seen in Numerical Recipies, or q as used in class for a system 
 * with changed variables or some other representation of state.  Here we use p because
 * in this assignment you should be thinking of it as the phase space state.  
 * 
 * The reason that y is sometime used is because you can draw a graph with time in the 
 * horizontal x axis, then y would be your normal vertical axis.  This is also the conventional variable
 * name in the numerical recipes book.  However, you will use p.
 * 
 * p (phase space state)
